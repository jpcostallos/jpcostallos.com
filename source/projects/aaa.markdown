### Overview

Stepping into a professional "Corporate" office for the first time in my life was terrifying at first. Seeing such a high level of developers and designers at work initially gave me a brief moment of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">Imposter Syndrome</a>". I found myself asking questions and doubting my skills. However, after a few weeks into the position I realized that they didn't expect me to be an expert at all things web. AAA just needed a fresh perspective on UI and someone to pick up the extra work. This, for me, was a relief. I was able to learn and practice something that I hadn't taken a deep dive into before. I was thinking, acting, and working like a true UI Designer. I made decisions and stepped out of my typical line of thought while designing. I worked with Photoshop and layer comps instead of my typical HTML, Sass, and JavaScript.

### Iterative Design 
My mentor and I would constantly review and make iterations on my work. Sometimes it was good and other times it needed work. I grew a thicker skin and learned that it's just part of the job. But ultimately, change and iteration is what makes a better experience for the user. 

The internship as a whole was a learning experience on many different levels. I learned technical work of course, but also I picked up on how the professional field is. You have a sense of autonomy being in a professional environment. There are of course times when you need to come through with projects and work but your expected to mainly maintain motivation yourself during the tough times.

### Reflections
Working at AAA also showed me side of the industry that I had not known before. The only previous working experiences I had in the web field was agency life. This new evironment (corporate lifestyle) allows for a more structured style of working. I've always considered myself a creative person but without structure I sometimes struggle with the scope of projects. I think working in both corporate and agency life would allow for me to further my experiences and career as both are huge on collaboration and allow the same sense of autonomy. 

Along with the internship I spent much of summer prepping for postgraduate life. I know once fall starts (my last semester) it'll go by quickly and I don't want to find myself on graduation day with nowhere to work. I attended conference, made new connections, read articles, took extra online courses, and looked for career opportunities. This, "soul searching" over the course of the summer all lead me to learn that others in the field were people just like me. People who spoke at conferences and wrote blog posts, constantly talked about the exact feeing that I experienced earlier I the summer at AAA. "How can I learn this stuff", "Everyone else knows so much more". I was reminded to just keep doing what I love and more importantly:

*	Work Hard
*	Stay Positive
*	Stay passionate
*	Be humble

Other things will fall into place. Make opportunities for yourself, and don't be afraid to try new things. It's a comfort to know that I'm on the right path and I know that Iâ€™m doing it because I want to, not because I feel I need too.

This summer was a wealth vast ocean of great opportunities and I couldn't have asked for a better way to spend my final break of college as "Real Life" is rapidly approaching.
