### Overview

Flight Treks is a premier flight training school based out of the Orlando International Airport, specializing in customer focused instruction for future aviators. I had the opportunity to craft a small yet stylish website to draw more attention to the company, while providing vital information to their customers.


### Quick Turnaround
The Flight Treks site was a quickly designed and developed project. The company had several events coming up and wanted to make sure the site was live before they occured. I set a goal for myself to work quickly and effeciently as to have the project delivered on time with room for iterations if needed.

Because the website design had custom features, yet needed to be fully modular I decided using a out-of-the-box [skeleton theme](http://themble.com/bones/) was probably a good start. The theme itself comes bare bones with only the necessities, such as a grid, custom post types, and minor base styles. Usually with projects of a larger size I tend to roll my own grid, and write my own custom functions for my WordPress posts.

Using this new skeleton theme was a great start for the project and allowed me to effeciently and cleanly create a modular site for the client and saved a lot of time to boot.

### SVGss
The mockups I was provided for this project from our designer came with some unique hover effects and images/icons. I decided I could save some time and get some unique functionality by SVGs instead of typical assets like jpgs and pngs.

Using SVGs allowed me to perform css transforms, and color transitions swiftly and smoothly all throughout the project. SVGs are also mobile friendly and allow for a more modular, and lightweight site build.

*	Small file sizes
*	Scales to any size without losing clarity
*	Great for retina displays
*	Easy to control with CSS and JS

### Reflection
During the course of this project I learned a lot about my workflow and about selecting the correct tools for the job.

Growing up I was always told to work smarter, not harder and I believe that this project was the perfect example of that practice.

Small quick projects are some of my favorite types of projects to work on. They provide the opportunity to streamline workflow while trying new tools to get the job done.
